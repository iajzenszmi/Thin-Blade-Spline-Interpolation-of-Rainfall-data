Show the results of an example thin blade spline interpolation of daily rainfall for a weather station.

Certainly! In this example, let's imagine you have daily rainfall data for a weather station and you want to perform thin-plate spline interpolation to generate a smooth curve that represents the rainfall pattern.

We'll use thin-plate splines to interpolate the given rainfall data across the days of a month. Note that thin-plate splines are usually used to interpolate multi-dimensional data, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll use it in a 1D context to model the rainfall data over time.

python

import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import Rbf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Days of the month (1-30)
days = np.array([1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30])

# Sample daily rainfall data for the corresponding days
rainfall = np.array([5, 2, 12, 8, 4, 10, 6])

# Create the interpolator using thin-plate spline
rbf = Rbf(days, rainfall, function='thin_plate')

# Create a grid to evaluate the interpolator for each day of the month
days_grid = np.linspace(1, 30, 100)
rainfall_interpolated = rbf(days_grid)

# Plot the original data points
plt.scatter(days, rainfall, c='red', label='Original Data')

# Plot the interpolated rainfall data
plt.plot(days_grid, rainfall_interpolated, c='blue', label='Interpolated Curve')
plt.title('Thin-Plate Spline Interpolation of Daily Rainfall')
plt.xlabel('Day of the Month')
plt.ylabel('Rainfall (mm)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()

This code snippet will plot the original rainfall data points along with the interpolated curve generated using thin-plate spline interpolation. The interpolated curve represents a smooth pattern of rainfall across the month.

This method helps in visualizing and understanding the pattern of rainfall throughout the month, and the interpolation can provide estimated values for days where the data is missing or needed for further analysis.
